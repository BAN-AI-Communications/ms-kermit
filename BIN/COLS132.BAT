echo MS-DOS Kermit does not know how to support 132-column mode on your
echo video adapter.  If you have an external command or program that puts
echo your adapter into 132-column mode, please edit the COLS132.BAT file to
echo run that command, and then Kermit will use it to switch to 132 columns.
echo Otherwise, 132-column mode cannot be used.
