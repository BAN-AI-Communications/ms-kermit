echo MS-DOS Kermit does not know how to switch between 132 and 80 columns on
echo your video adapter.  If you have an external command or program that can
echo switch your adapter between 132- and 80-column mode, please edit the
echo COLS80.BAT and COLS132.BAT files to run those commands, and then Kermit
echo will use them.  Otherwise, 132-column mode cannot be used.
