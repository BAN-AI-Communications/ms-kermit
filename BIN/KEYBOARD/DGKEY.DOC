	       DGKEY.COM TSR FOR THE DATA GENERAL DASHER/286 PC

DGKEY.COM is a simple TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program for use with
the Data General (DG) DASHER/286 PC, which has two keys that are normally
invisible to MS-DOS Kermit, but which are important for DASHER terminal
emulation:

  SPCL - Normally used for composing accented characters
  HOME - Normally used for backspacing

The DGKEY.COM program makes these keys return the following scan codes, which
are seen by Kermit, and which can be used with Kermit's SET KEY command:

  SPCL - \2335
  HOME - \3363

DGKEY.COM is an adaptation by Joe Doupnik of Bob Eager's GOLD.COM program.
In all other aspects of operation, DGKEY.COM is identical to GOLD.COM, which
is described in the file GOLD.DOC (MSUGOLD.DOC).
