             GOLD - Simulate GOLD Key with NUM LOCK - Version 2.4

                             Bob Eager, June 1992

Overview
-------- 
GOLD.COM (MSUGOLD.COM) is a simple TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program
intended to make it easier to use MS-DOS Kermit as an emulator for DEC VT100
and higher model VT series terminals on a PC with an enhanced keyboard (the
one with separate numeric pad and cursor keys).

What GOLD does is make the NUM LOCK key transmit the code for some other
key (normally the F1 key; this is usually mapped by Kermit to the VTnnn
GOLD key).  This makes it possible (by using the SET KEY command of
Kermit) to make the keypad look almost exactly the same as a VTnnn
keypad (the long + key is the only exception; that is two keys on the
real terminal). 

Using GOLD
----------
To use GOLD, simply place the GOLD.COM file into a directory on the
normal program path, then type the command:

  GOLD

This activates the program, and NUM LOCK will cease to work as Num Lock and
will instead operate the same as the F1 key (or whatever else has been
configured).  This may not always be convenient, so it is possible to turn off
the effect by typing:

  GOLD OFF

and later to turn it on again by typing:

  GOLD ON

The current GOLD state may be displayed by typing:

  GOLD

(after the first call, this is the only effect if the command is used without
parameters).  The program can be set to an initial OFF state by calling it the
first time with the OFF parameter if required.  Later calls operate with the
initially installed copy of the program, which cannot be unloaded (it is,
however, very small; only 528 or 592 bytes of memory are required, depending
on the operating mode (see below)).

It is possible to get the original Num Lock function without turning GOLD
OFF.  This is useful if you are inside an application and realise Num Lock has
been left ON accidentally, and GOLD is also ON.  The key combination Shift and
Num Lock will toggle the Num Lock state each time it is used (just as Num Lock
does on its own when GOLD is OFF).

It is also possible to turn GOLD on and off without calling it as a command.
The key combination Alt and Num Lock will turn GOLD off if it is on, and on if
it is off.  Note that Alt and Num Lock normally operates exactly as a normal
Num Lock, so no functionality is lost when GOLD is loaded.

If you are using DOS 5, GOLD may be loaded using the LOADHIGH command; this
saves space if upper memory space is available.

Compatibility
-------------
Some machines may not contain BIOS support for this program; in such cases,
GOLD automatically uses an alternate operating mode (direct interception of
keyboard interrupts) which will work on true compatible machines.  However,
this method uses slightly more memory (544 bytes against 480 bytes) and
requires a high degree of machine compatibility.

Problems have been reported where GOLD appears to have no effect, even if each
of the particular modes is forced.  In many cases this appears to be due to a
version of the KEYB (or KEYBxx) command used for reconfiguring non-US
keyboards; it steals the keyboard interrupt vector and fails to honour the
keyboard intercept request from GOLD.  The solution is generally to use an
earlier version of the KEYB program (or one of the country specific versions
such as KEYBUK) or to use a KEYB program from a PC-DOS system; these appear
not to have the problem.


Configuration
-------------
The program uses the INT 2FH multiplex interrupt to install itself; it uses a
multiplex ID of 0DCH.  This may be changed if it clashes with other TSR
programs.  The key to which NUM LOCK is mapped may also be changed, and it may
also be transmitted as if SHIFT, CTRL or ALT is held down at the same time.
It is also possible to force GOLD to use a particular operating mode (BIOS
keyboard intercept, or direct keyboard interrupt intercept).

Alteration of the above items is obvious on examination of the program source
code.  If you do not have MASM, it is easy to patch the program since the
relevant values are stored in easy to find places - offsets 102H, 103H, 104H
and 105H.

GOLD has been tested on PC-DOS 3.0, 3.1, 3.3, 5.0, MS-DOS 3.2, 3.3 and 5.0,
and in the DOS mode sessions of IBM OS/2 versions 1.2, 1.3 and 2.0.  Tests
were performed on an IBM PC/XT compatible (PC-DOS and MS-DOS all versions), an
IBM PC/XT (PC-DOS version 3.3) and an IBM PS/2 Model 80-111 (PC-DOS versions
3.3 and 5.0, and OS/2).

Files included

This package should consist of the following files.  Please distribute
all of these files if you pass the package on. 

GOLD.COM   - Executable program for GOLD

GOLD.INI   - Kermit TAKE file to define keyboard for DEC terminal

NOTE: In the Kermit Distribution area, all these filenames are prefixed by
the letters MSU, e.g. MSUGOLD.COM, to keep them together with other MS-DOS
Kermit files.

Acknowledgement
---------------
Thanks to all those, all over the world, who have contacted me with
suggestions for improvements to GOLD.  There are too many to mention
individually, and many people made the same or similar suggestions.

Update history
--------------

2.4 - fixed problem where PAUSE was being recognised as if NUM LOCK
      had been pressed. This was because PAUSE generates a six byte
      data sequence containing, as its third byte, the scan code used
      by NUM LOCK

2.3 - added facility to include CTRL, ALT or SHIFT with replacement key code

2.2 - added some additional safety code to the installation check

2.1 - changed default multiplex ID value to 09FH to fix problems with
      some versions of KEYB

2.0 - added SHIFT and NUM LOCK facility to provide original NUM LOCK capability
    - added ALT and NUM LOCK facility to change GOLD status directly
    - fixed interrupt intercept incompatibility with some clone BIOSes
    - fixed non-detection of BIOS intercept support in some cases
    - added code to use direct keyboard interrupt handler if BIOS
      interrupt intercept facility not available

1.0 - initial program version
