This TSR causes real (unique) NumLock scan code to be returned to DOS instead
of toggling the NumLock state.  It is not perfect, but it works.  As seen
from MS-DOS Kermit, the scan code is \325.  This differs from the GOLD.COM
program, which replicates the F1 key scan code, \315.  Thus with WPGGOLD.COM
you can use your F1 and Num Lock keys for different things.

WPGGOLD.COM should be placed into a directory with the other programs, such
as Kermit, with which it is to be used.

This program must be (re)loaded onto the DOS machine after each reboot before
it can be used.  This can be accomplished by executing the following command
from the DOS prompt and/or adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

    WPGGOLD LOAD

This loading should never be done from a program or a secondary DOS session
created on top of a running program.  Loading this TSR consumes about 800
bytes of conventional memory which is never returned to the DOS session.

When first loaded, the interception of the NumLock key will be disabled.
After it is loaded, the TSR's NumLock interception and reporting may be
enabled at any time with the following command:

    WPGGOLD ENABLE

and disabled at any time with the following command:

    WPGGOLD DISABLE

These commands are automatically executed by the vmswp313.ini Kermit 3.13
keymapping script if WPGGOLD.COM is on the executable environment path, has
been loaded, and "set terminal apc unchecked" has been performed.
