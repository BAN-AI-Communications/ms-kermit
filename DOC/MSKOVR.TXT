                          MS-DOS Kermit Specifications

Requirements

   IBM PC 8088 or above, or compatible, running DOS 2.0 or later or Microsoft
   Windows 3.x or earlier, with a serial port, modem, or network adapter.
   Requires between about 160K and 400K to run, depending on options
   selected.

   MS-DOS Kermit is a Windows-aware DOS program. It has a text-mode, not
   graphical, user interface. Under Windows, it can run in a window or
   full-screen and it can execute in the background; for example,
   transferring files while you are using some other application in the
   foreground. While it is recommended for Windows 3.x or earlier, it is not
   recommended for Windows 95 or NT, for a which a native Kermit program is
   available, Kermit 95.

Communication Methods

   Serial connections are supported for COM1-COM4 at speeds up to at least
   57,600 bps; RTS/CTS hardware flow control is available for use with
   high-speed modems. Support for buffered UARTs, Hayes ESP, and Fossil
   drivers. Automatic modem dialing scripts are included for Hayes, Telebit,
   US Robotics, Practical Peripherals, and many other modems, and there is an
   easy-to-use dialing directory.

   Network connections include TCP/IP (built-in, with up to six concurrent
   sessions), AT&T StarLAN / StarGROUP, DEC PATHWORKS (LAT and CTERM
   connections), NETBIOS, IBM LANACS, Novell NASI/NACS, Novell LWP TELAPI,
   3COM BAPI, Beame & Whiteside TCP/IP, Intel OpenNET, Ungermann Bass
   Net/One, Interconnections TES, Meridian Technology SuperLAT, as well as
   BIOS Interrupt 14 support for externally-established network connections.
   TCP/IP connections require a packet driver (Ethernet or SLIP class) or an
   ODI driver, and can coexist with Novell IPX connections. NOTE: MS-DOS
   Kermit is not a Winsock client.

   (international models), VT102, VT100, VT52, Data General DASHER D463 and
   D470 (and D217 in version 3.15), Wyse-50, Heath/Zenith-19, plus Tektronix
   4014 and Sixel graphics. Terminal emulation features include screen
   rollback, capture, copy, and print; 132-column mode; horizontal scrolling;
   key mapping and macros; comprehensive character-set support; a compose key
   for entering accented letters; color text and graphics; much more.

File Transfer

   MS-DOS Kermit offers the fastest and most advanced Kermit file transfer
   protocol implementation available for DOS or Windows 3.x. It also provides
   easy access to external protocols, and allows unguarded capture and
   transmission of text files.

   Kermit Protocol features include long packets, sliding windows, dynamic
   packet length, locking shifts, control-character "unprefixing," and
   international character-set conversion for Western and Eastern European
   languages, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Japanese. And, new to version 3.14, file
   transfer recovery for interrupted binary-mode transfers.

Automation Features

   Automation features include autodownload and autoupload, command macros,
   command files, and a powerful, easy-to-use script programming language
   complete with variables, functions, loops, and so on.
