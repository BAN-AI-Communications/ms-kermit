MS-DOS KERMIT DEC KEYBOARD SETUPS FOR THE IBM PC, PS/2, AND COMPATIBLES

The IBM PC version of MS-DOS Kermit comes with a default mapping of VT terminal
functions to IBM keys, as documented in "Using MS-DOS Kermit.  These mappings
are in effect during terminal emulation, not at the MS-Kermit> command prompt,
and not outside of Kermit.

Kermit's default mappings do not include the DEC LK201 (VT200, VT300) keyboard
function (F) keys or editing keys (Insert Here, Remove, Select, etc), so you
will not be able to use host-resident applications that expect you to press
these keys unless you execute Kermit SET KEY commands to make these assigments.

Kermit's repertoire of "keyboard verbs" includes verbs for all DEC keyboard
keys: F-keys (Function keys), Editing keys, Arrow keys, and so on.  The file
VT300.INI contains SET KEY commands that set up both types of IBM keyboard
(88-key and 101-key) to resemble the DEC keyboard as closely as possible.  The
layout for the 101 "Extended" (PS/2) keyboard is very similar to the DEC
keyboard, except for the F-keys.  DEC F keys go up to 20, but the IBM-101 only
has 12 F keys.  The IBM-88 keyboard is harder to lay out because it lacks an
editing keypad, and has only 10 F keys.

The settings for the numeric keypad work whether you have Num Lock On or Off.
The top rank of the numeric keypad cannot normally be used for the DEC Gold
and PF keys because the Num Lock key, which does not normally generate a scan
code when you press it, occupies the position of the DEC Gold (PF1) key.
Therefore the IBM F1-F4 keys are used for the DEC PF1-PF4 keys.

To use Num Lock as the PF1 (Gold) key, load either the GOLD.COM or WPGGOLD.COM
TSR before starting Kermit; these are supplied on your Kermit diskette - read
the accompanying DOC files for further info.

To put the DEC keyboard settings into effect, issue the command TAKE VT300.INI
at the MS-Kermit> prompt (supplying a full pathname if necessary, e.g.  TAKE
C:\KERMIT\KEYBOARD\VT300.INI), or put this command into your MSCUSTOM.INI file
to make it take effect automatically whenever you start Kermit.  To restore
Kermit's default key settings, issue the command SET KEY CLEAR.

The DEC Compose Key function is accomplished by Alt-c, keyboard verb \Kcompose.

See VT300.INI for the actual key mappings.  Modify to suite your preferences.
