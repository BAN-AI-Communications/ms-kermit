PKTADDR is a small program that you can use to find out the hardware address
of your network board if you have a packet driver loaded for the board.  Just
type:

  pktaddr 0x60

at the DOS prompt.  This assumes that the packet driver is using interrupt 60
hex, which is the most commonly used address.  If your network has a BOOTP
server, you can report the hardware address to your network manager so your PC
can be entered in the BOOTP table.  This allows MS-DOS Kermit to obtain all
the necessary TCP/IP parameters from the BOOTP server, provided you have told
MS-DOS Kermit (e.g. in your MSCUSTOM.INI file) to SET TCP/IP ADDRESS BOOTP.
