   Subject: Order for "Using MS-DOS Kermit:

   Dear Kermit Project:

   Thank you for producing one of the finest pieces of software I have ever
   used. It truly belongs in the category of "timeless & bulletproof", along
   with such software as PKZIP and...well, it's hard to think of others that
   belong in that category!

   As I compose this mail, it is the first time I've used Netscape since I
   downloaded MS-DOS Kermit 3.15. My ISP uses C-Kermit 5A(189), which makes
   for incredibly fast, error-free file transfers. Of course, I'm urging them
   to upgrade to 6.0.

   It's a travesty that Kermit (the protocol) has developed a reputation of
   "slow-but-sure". My experience has shown Kermit to be "fast-AND-sure". I
   run the FAST macro from MSCUSTOM.INI and have yet to encounter *any*
   errors when retrieving files from my server. (I assure you that I am *not*
   connected to my server via null-modem ;)

   I could go on for days (as I'm sure I will *anyway*), but I'll leave you
   with this: I am able to run MS-Kermit (medium) off of a 720KB boot disk
   (with MORE.COM and FIND.EXE being the only additional DOS components
   necessary, and the freeware TED.COM (2KB) as my default text editor). This
   is truly portable. This is truly freedom. This is cool.

   Thank you so much for answering my email.

   BTW, I've read the Using MS-DOS Kermit. I found the section on diagnosing
   connections clear and concise. I also found your explanations of error
   correcting modes and compression quite useful and for the first time
   understand them and the differences between. No other source has been able
   to teach me these concepts as clearly.

   Thanks again.

FROM REVIEWS OF "USING MS-DOS KERMIT"...

   "Ms. Gianone has acquired considerable experience and expertise in guiding
   users around the world through the various trials and pitfalls of
   installing and using this surprisingly powerful and capable software
   package. The results of that accumulated wisdom are contained in one of
   the finest user guides, commercial, shareware, or otherwise, that this
   reviewer has had the pleasure of reading."

     Tom Nichol, Link-Up, July/August 1990 (p.8)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   "An excellent introduction to computer communications, [Using MS-DOS
   Kermit] explains in simple but intelligent language how to set up and get
   going." "Must-read for PC buffs..."

     Anne M. Russell, Working Woman, September 1990 (p.94)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   "[In her] book, 'Using MS-DOS Kermit' [Christine Gianone] explains in
   simple, lighthearted prose how to set up and use Version 3.0 of the
   full-function communication tool for the entire IBM PC and PS/2 family and
   compatibles. ... I thought a basic comm program ought to cost at least
   $150, or else it might be too buggy to be effective... I thought shareware
   like Kermit probably is lots more difficult to learn than its commercial
   cousins. Well, I've been wrong on both counts. ... Is Kermit easy to use?
   Yes. As an experiment, I popped my copy into the B drive of my 80386 PC
   clone after scanning Gianone's book for about 10 minutes. Within five
   minutes I had programmed it to connect with MCI Mail, which I'm using to
   send this column to GCN."

     J.B. Miles, Government Computer News, April 30, 1990 (pp.29,32)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   "One of [Kermit's] problems has always been that the documentation ... has
   been difficult for the novice to comprehend. 'Using MS-DOS Kermit' has
   come to the rescue. This [is an] extremely readable book... Christine
   Gianone manages to reach out to the absolute novice ... [and also] appeals
   to the more experienced user. For those who have been using Kermit this
   book contains a lot of useful information ... about how to use this
   program more effectively. For those who have not used Kermit, this book
   will open a new door and, unlike so many software manuals, will encourage
   you to cross the threshold. I strongly recommend this book..."

     - Trevor Cradduck, Newsletter of the American Association of Physicists
     in Medicine, May/June 1990, pp.12-13.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   "[Using MS-DOS Kermit] is exceptionally well written and it explains all
   of the necessary technical terms so [nontechnical] readers will not feel
   intimidated. ... The presentation style and format are quite good,
   particularly given that the book is aimed at nontechnical readers who
   hesitate to even look at software manuals. ... While the book is aimed at
   nontechnical readers, I highly recommend it to all technical personnel in
   the computing field, particularly those who abhore software manuals. Also,
   those in data communications who get lots of requests for help from their
   nontechnical colleagues may want to direct them to this book."

   "Yow! Here's all you need to connect your PC to the world of networks,
   modems, and mainframes. Solid software with plenty of help, for both the
   novice and the expert.

   Kermit moves your files to distant computers, lets you talk over bulletin
   boards, send electronic mail and even runs by remote control. You'll find
   Kermit wherever computers communicate -- it's truly the universal language
   for computers."

     Clifford Stoll, author of the best-seller, The Cuckoo's Egg.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   "Using MS-DOS Kermit covers all the topics needed to start new users
   easily, and it does so in a natural progression . . . The pace is a lot
   faster than readers will realize, mostly because the writing is skillfully
   done--crisp, often entertaining, and always to the point. This is a
   terrific book!"

     Professor Joe R. Doupnik
     Utah State University

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This book is an excellent introduction for the novice, and this second
   edition is a complete reference for the expert. The Second edition
   describes all the new features of version 3.11, including everything that
   was added in versions 3.01, 3.02 and 3.10. It has a new chapter on local
   area networks (including TCP/IP); a new appendix with a complete technical
   description of Kermit's terminal emulator with tables of all the escape
   sequences recognized and sent by Kermit in both text and graphics mode;
   and expanded descriptions of many of Kermit's features, including
   instructions on programming scripts. There are also instructions for
   running Kermit under Windows and DesqView.

   Using MS-DOS Kermit, Gianone, 1992

   On the one hand, I don't like this book. It is responsible for the fact
   that the full Kermit documentation isn't included with the standard MS-DOS
   Kermit distribution any more. On the other hand, I like this book. It is
   responsible for the wider acceptance Kermit is having these days, and
   Kermit is an excellent protocol, system and program.

   Frank da Cruz can't exactly be seen as a disinterested bystander regarding
   all things "Kermit", so his praise of the book and its author in the
   Foreword are a bit suspect. By the end of chapter one, however, I was
   willing to suspend disbelief. It is one of the best general descriptions
   of the terminal emulation and file transfer processes I have ever read,
   pitched at just the right level for the non-technical reader. Chapter two
   is a quick look at getting started with Kermit on MS-DOS, and three is a
   quick look at MS-DOS, itself. Again, chapter three is about all most
   people need to know to use DOS on a hard disk, presented in admirable
   form.

   Chapter four deals fully with connection of modems, serial cables and
   phone jacks. Five covers testing of the setup, and some troubleshooting
   tests. Unlike most commercial communications program manuals, who want you
   to call their own BBS (long distance), the author has found an 800 number
   service to try out. (And it even works from Canada.)

   The process of using the program starts with chapter six. In proper
   pedagogical style, the user is introduced to the invocation and
   termination of the program, and the help system, along with some examples
   of the command structure. Chapter seven, entitled, "Getting Online",
   discusses communications parameters, not simply in terms of the commands
   needed, but describes what each parameter is, and what might result from
   an error. There is a brief discussion of MNP (Microcom Networking
   Protocol), which provides error correction and data compression in modern
   modems), and, although I have no right to expect it, I wish there was a
   bit on modem commands and settings here.

   Chapters eight to twelve cover the basics of communications commands.
   Terminal emulation is discussed thoroughly, and leads to key reassignment.
   File transfer, in chapter nine, leads to Kermit server operations: on the
   host in chapter ten, and the PC as server in chapter eleven. Chapter
   twelve covers non-protocol ASCII transfers.

   Chapter thirteen revisits terminal emulation with character sets and
   translations. This, of course, also covers character translations in file
   transfer. Chapter fourteen is the longest except for the command
   reference: it deals with macros and scripts. Even here the book does not
   become too technical; the intelligent novice should be quite comfortable
   in writing some fairly advanced scripts. Chapter fifteen is cute: it
   covers features for the physically, auditorily or visually challenged--and
   jumps from the previous ten point type up to fourteen point in order to do
   it. Network connections are discussed in chapter sixteen and, as promised,
   the command reference is in seventeen. The command reference also covers
   non-standard environments and devices.

   The glossary that Gianone has put together is of the same quality. Quite
   complete in terms of both data communications and the MS-DOS platform, the
   entries are clear and accessible to the intelligent novice.

   Three appendices round out the book. One is a set of tables of
   information, ranging from RS-232 pin assignments through selected "Hayes
   compatible" AT commands to ASCII codes. The second is a set of terminal
   "escape" sequences, while the third is a description of the files on the
   Kermit distribution diskette. At first I was a bit taken aback at the
   technical level of these appendices. These are the type of tables that I
   have been collecting for years while doing communications disgnostics and
   consulting. On the other hand, all it proves is that this book is for
   techies, too. I'll certainly be using it for reference in place of some of
   my well thumbed old tattered pages.

   Buy this book. If you are thinking of using MS-Kermit, buy this book. It
   is excellent documentation, and you get a free copy of MS-Kermit with it.
   If you are thinking of using Kermit on various platforms, buy this book.
   It is excellent documentation on Kermit as a whole, since the various
   versions at least make an attempt to present a consistent interface. If
   you are happy with another communications package, won't consider using
   non-commercial software, use a Mac and would never be caught dead using a
   command line interface, buy this book. It is an excellent presentation of
   data communications, and explains the functions, and not merely which keys
   to press. The material is broadly based, and is applicable to many systems
   of terminal emulation and file transfer.

   And who knows, you may just end up using Kermit after all ...

   From Log in -- Informatik und Computer in der Schule,

     Jahrgang 13, Heft 3'93, pp. 67-68.

     Translation from the original German by Frank da Cruz

   "The best things in life are free", sang the Rolling Stones some thirty
   years ago. This line frequently occurs to me when I get steamed about
   commercial software that is so often distributed according to the "Banana
   principle" (let it ripen with the customer). In contrast to this there are
   truly astounding featureful and bug-free software packages that are freely
   available to anybody who is interested. Without a doubt, programs of the
   famous Kermit family belong in this category: in the truest sense,
   "vine-ripened" products that reliably do what one expects.

   The main uses of Kermit programs are in two different yet related areas:
   safe data transfer from computer to computer ("uploading" and
   "downloading") using the Kermit protocol and -- in the desktop versions --
   terminal emulation.

   By now, Kermit programs exist for almost every kind of computer, and are
   freely available from Columbia University. For micros (PC or Macintosh)
   the program comes in executable form with startup, help, and example
   files, and for UNIX and VMS systems it comes in C source code form with a
   makefile.

   For two classes of users, it's useful to get further information in
   printed form: for beginners in the field of data transfer, more precise
   information than they would get from short help files. On the other hand,
   if one wants to take fullest advantage of the comprehensive features of
   MS-DOS Kermit, it is helpful to have a reference work by your PC. Both
   needs are eminently fulfilled by the book Using MS-DOS Kermit by
   Christine M. Gianone.

   The book is not free, but at 79 Marks, in a hardbound edition with over
   400 pages, it is a good bargain. It includes a diskette with the latest
   version of MS-DOS Kermit, so all you need to get started in the world of
   data transfer is a PC, a modem, and a telephone connection with the right
   cables. It even works on old PC/XTs with at least 190KB free memory and
   DOS 2.0 or later, a diskette drive, and a serial port.

   In the early chapters you get instructions for installation and a short
   introduction to MS-DOS, valuable information on the tricky topics of
   cables, connections, and modems (chapter 4), Testing the Connection (Ch
   5), Running MS-DOS Kermit (Ch 6) and a discussion of the connection,
   including how to set the right communications parameters (Ch 7). In these
   70 pages, the beginner gets concrete help with the first steps. These
   initial steps are eased by the well-written, readable, and amusing text,
   painstakingly translated into German, and numerous illustrations.

   Terminal emulation turns a PC into a terminal to a host. The connection
   can be direct through a serial cable, via modem and phone connection, or
   through a local area network -- all these connection methods are supported
   by MS-DOS Kermit; a whole chapter (16) is dedicated to using Kermit on
   LANs. Using Kermit to emulate a terminal on diverse hosts (VMS, UNIX, IBM
   mainframe) is explained step-by-step in chapter 8. MS-DOS Kermit supports
   DEC VT52, VT100, VT102, VT220, and VT320 as well as Tektronix 4010/4014
   graphics terminals. In addition to the native capabilities of these
   terminals, Kermit lets you roll the screen back -- very handy since one
   frequently wants to read something that has just scrolled off the screen.
   Graphics images can be saved in TIFF files so other programs can import
   them.

   With only these capabilities one can readily accomplish trivial types of
   data transfer from mainframe to PC, by displaying the desired information
   and logging it to a file. We use these capabilities almost daily at our
   school, e.g. to get the latest mail from the CAMPUS 2000 BBS in London to
   our school's computer.

   In many cases, however, this type of data transfer is not sufficient; when
   we must go through double digital/analog conversion and through bad phone
   connections, signals can get crossed. This is a particular problem when
   transferring binary data. For these reasons, the Kermit protocol was
   developed in 1981 at Columbia University in New York by Bill Catchings and
   Frank da Cruz. The basic idea of this protocol is for the sender to break
   up the data into packets. The receiving computer then checks each packet
   to make sure it came through all right or must be resent. In this way, one
   can transfer data correctly even over very bad connections. Although there
   are other important protocols like XMODEM, Kermit is so widespread that
   many communication programs support it.

   Chapter 9 of the book describes the process of data transfer step by step
   from the user's point of view. Here we also learn how to send groups of
   files with the help of wildcards. Kermit's server mode (ch 10) is
   especially convenient. Chapter 11 describes how to set up MS-DOS Kermit
   for PC-to-PC data transfer. The topic of data transfer is capped off with
   an overview of how to transfer data without the Kermit protocol (ch 12).

   Today, all major types of computers have the ability to represent "special
   characters" like a-diaeresis, ess-zet, e-circumflex, n-tilde, etc. If one
   transfers files between different kinds of computers, however, one
   frequently experiences unpleasant surprises: "For example, a food
   importer's order for pâté composed on the PC might appear on the screen of
   the supplier's Macintosh as peta, and a delivery of pocket bread shows up
   instead of goose liver."

   The cause of this confusion is revealed in Chapter 13 (International
   Character Sets): Unfortunately, computer manufacturers have neglected to
   settle on a binding standard for 8 bit characters. Kermit offers an escape
   from this 8-bit chaos, for both file transfer and terminal emulation:
   appropriate translation tables can ensure that (e.g.) pâté remains pâté on
   the PC and the Macintosh or UNIX. I don't know of any other communications
   program that offers anywhere near comparable features in the support of
   international character sets.

   Of course, Kermit is also programmable. Chapter 14 describes the ways to
   automate -- through macros, command files, and scripts -- dialing
   procedures, login procedures, etc, and even file transfer.

   In contrast to most other communications programs, MS-DOS Kermit includes
   enhancements that enable the "disabled" to use the programm (Ch 15).

   A command overview (reference, ch 17), appendices with tables and escape
   sequences for its various terminal emulations, and a glossary-cum-buzzword
   list round out this book, which I can recommend to anyone who is looking
   to enter the world of data transfer or wants to use PCs as terminals.
